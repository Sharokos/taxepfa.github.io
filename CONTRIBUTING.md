# Contributing

This is a SSG React/Next.js application written in TypeScript.
It uses the outstanding Mantine UI framework and Valtio for state management.
I expect you to know of these things if you're planning to contribute.

## Important

Pushing to the `main` branch triggers a GitHub workflow, so make sure to target your PRs to the `dev` branch.

## Running in development mode

Required Node.js > 18 & `yarn`.
Run `yarn dev` in the project folder.
